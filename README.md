# Healthcare API Gateway

Single entry point for all client requests in the Healthcare Appointment System.
Routes incoming requests to the appropriate downstream microservice and provides
cross-cutting concerns like rate limiting and monitoring.

Part of the Healthcare Appointment System built for SEZG583 - Scalable Services assignment.

## Tech Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.5.13
- Spring Cloud Gateway
- Spring Boot Actuator
- Maven

## Port
Runs on **port 8080**
